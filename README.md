## Wins
- Played around with Figma finally, understood why adobe bought it over for 20bil.
- Troubleshotting the current stack gets easier along the way.
- Toyed around with DND-KIT.
  
- ## Difficulties
- Manipulating DOM
- Relied too much on statelifting
- Difficulty understanding documentation and what I need

- ## Technical challenges
- Lack of understanding on whats going on in a drag and drop to do list app. Thought a drag and drop feature actually takes just generally useContext, pickup, useDrag, useDrop to execute. Apparently theres way more going on. (trello cost 425mil O.o!)
  
- ## Improvement for the future
- Board Schema shall have 4 catagories each holding an array of objectIDs for tasks instead of 1. This eliminates the use of Enums and should synergise better with sortableContext.
- React app structure differently so I avoid statelifting from child to parent to another child, after which make api call and pass data as props and app crashes again Zz..
